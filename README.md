# Welcome!

I'm **Zachary**, but most people know me as **KittehKun** online. I'm a game dev, web developer, and IT guy who spends way too much time making cool VR worlds and fixing other people's tech problems (and sometimes my own). 

I love building stuff that actually works AND is fun to use - whether that's a VRChat world that doesn't lag or a website that doesn't make you want to throw your computer out the window.

## What I Do

**Game Development**  
I make VRChat worlds like *Raiders of Haven* that people actually want to hang out in. Turns out making games that don't crash every five minutes requires some decent coding skills - who knew?

**Web Development**  
I build websites and web apps using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Also dabbled in Spring Boot and the classic Bootstrap + jQuery combo (don't judge me, we've all been there).

**IT Support & Systems**  
When I'm not coding, I'm probably troubleshooting someone's computer or managing systems. It's like being a digital janitor, but with more Active Directory and SCCM.

**Always Learning**  
The tech world moves fast, so I'm constantly picking up new frameworks and tools. Currently obsessing over making my React apps faster and my Unity projects less of a memory hog.

## My Toolkit

**Languages:** C#, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS  
**Game Dev:** Unity, Blender, VRChat SDK, Git (when it doesn't hate me)  
**Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Bootstrap  
**Backend:** Spring Boot, SQL  
**IT Stuff:** Active Directory, SCCM, ticketing systems, fixing printers (unfortunately)

## Stuff I've Built

### [Raiders of Haven (VRChat)](https://vrchat.com/home/launch?worldId=wrld_61f13d37-2af5-4f46-812a-275a35ad174b&instanceId=0)
My pride and joy - a VRChat world that actually runs smoothly! Took forever to optimize, but now people can actually enjoy it without their headsets catching fire.
- Built with Unity, Blender, and way too much caffeine
- Features custom scripting in U# and C# that doesn't break multiplayer

### [Cat-Kun Discord Bot](https://github.com/KittehKun/Cat-Kun-Discord-Bot)
Because every Discord server needs a bot with a cat theme, right? This one's written in C# and actually does useful stuff like moderation and community management.
- Modular design so you can add features without breaking everything
- Discord API integration that works most of the time

### [Moving Cat Website](https://github.com/KittehKun/Moving-Cat-Website)
Just a silly little project with bouncing cats. Sometimes you need a break from serious coding to make something completely pointless but fun.
- Built with Astro and JavaScript
- Responsive design because even bouncing cats deserve mobile support

### VRChat Portfolio Site (Still Working On It)
My attempt at a proper portfolio site using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. Taking forever because I keep refactoring everything, but that's the developer life.
- Modern stack with Vite for that sweet, sweet hot reload
- Will showcase my VR projects once I stop tweaking the CSS
